## Welcome
I am currently a second year doctoral student in the [Department of Economics](https://www.econ.pitt.edu/) at the University of Pittsburgh. Prior to this year, I worked as a [Research Assistant](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/careers/students-and-graduates/) at the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/the-bureau/bureau-structure/research-markets-regulation/) in Washington DC. I graduated from Swarthmore College [with honors](https://www.swarthmore.edu/honors-program) in economics and psychology in May 2017. I am interested in the fields of behavioral economics, experimental economics, and applied microeconomics. My goal is to conduct research using experiments and survey data, teach, and apply my research to help people feel empowered over their financial lives.

## More About Me

I sing bass in the [Mendelssohn Choir](https://www.themendelssohn.org/). I was recently featured on the choir's [website](https://www.themendelssohn.org/about/meet-the-singers/).

While living in DC, I volunteered as a math tutor at a [youth center](https://www.northstartutoring.org/) and sang in the [National Cathedral Choral Society](http://www.cathedralchoralsociety.org/chorus). (Fun fact: I sang on a [GRAMMY nominated classical music album!](https://www.grammy.com/grammys/awards/winners-nominees/107))
