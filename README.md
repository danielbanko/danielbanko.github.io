## Welcome
I am currently a first year doctoral student in the [Department of Economics](https://www.econ.pitt.edu/) at the [University of Pittsburgh](pitt.edu). Prior to this year, I worked as a [Research Assistant](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/careers/students-and-graduates/) at the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/the-bureau/bureau-structure/research-markets-regulation/) in Washington DC. I graduated from Swarthmore College [with honors](https://www.swarthmore.edu/honors-program) in economics and psychology in May 2017. I am interested in the fields of behavioral economics, experimental economics, and applied microeconomics. I want to teach undergraduates, conduct research in an experimental decision-making lab, and apply my research to helping people feel empowered over their financial lives.

This is part of a series of quarterly reports of consumer credit trends produced by the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection using a longitudinal, nationally representative sample of approximately five million de-identified credit records maintained by one of the three nationwide credit reporting companies.
