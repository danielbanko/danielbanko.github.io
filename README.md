## Welcome
I work as a [Research Assistant](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/careers/students-and-graduates/) at the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/the-bureau/bureau-structure/research-markets-regulation/) in Washington DC. I graduated from Swarthmore College [with honors](https://www.swarthmore.edu/honors-program) in Economics and Psychology in May 2017. I am interested in behavioral finance and financial well-being research and plan to attend graduate school to earn a PhD in economics. I want to apply my research to help people take control over their financial lives.
