## Welcome
I am currently a second year doctoral student in the [Department of Economics at the University of Pittsburgh](https://www.econ.pitt.edu/). Prior to this, I worked as a [Research Assistant](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/careers/students-and-graduates/) at the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/the-bureau/bureau-structure/research-markets-regulation/) in Washington DC. I graduated from [Swarthmore College](https://www.swarthmore.edu) [with honors in economics and psychology](https://www.swarthmore.edu/honors-program) in May 2017. I am interested in the fields of behavioral economics, experimental economics, and applied microeconomics topics including labor, health, and household finance.
